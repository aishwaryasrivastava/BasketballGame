# Mario Basketball Game
This is a game that I designed with my team RebelScrum (Wen Gu, Huichen Yuan, Stephen Piddock, Jeremy Cain and I, Aishwarya Srivastava) 
for my game design class at the Ohio State University (Under the guidance of the wonderful Scott Mills).
This game features many game designing concepts such as collision, 2D camera, parallax scrolling, background music and sound effects.
Other than that, the game also makes use of many OOP concepts, design patterns, and general coding practices. 
This was a semester-long project that made us collaborate as a team and follow the Scrum framework. Kindly direct all questions and comments to srivastava.109@osu.edu. Thanks!
